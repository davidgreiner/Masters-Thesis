\chapter{Problem Statement}
\label{ch:Problem-Statement}

Treating a person with severe trauma is extremely challenging, as the injury may result in life-threatening effects on blood circulation and tissue oxygenation. Every decision can make the difference between life and death. After the first assessment by the emergency medical services (\gls{EMS}), the patient's medical state has to be continuously monitored. Upon arrival at the hospital, it is important for the trauma team to understand the patient's treatment history, including what medications have been administered and procedures have been performed. This information is vital to providing the most accurate and beneficial care. Such life-critical information may not be properly communicated when transferring the patient from the \gls{EMS} personnel's care to the hospital trauma team. Often \gls{EMS} personnel rely on their memory to communicate the patient's treatment history, which can be inaccurate. Failing to communicate a complete and accurate treatment history can lead to permanent damage or death. This thesis proposes an automatic reporting system using accelerometer, gyroscope, and electromyography (\gls{EMG}) data to detect a sub-set of common procedures performed on trauma patients. An algorithm that incorporates machine-learning will be developed to classify the sub-set of \gls{EMS} procedures based on the wearable sensor data.
\par Automatically detecting trauma procedures may improve the communication during the care transfer between EMS personnel and the trauma team. Some ambulances are equipped with devices that record the patient's vitals and statistics about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (\gls{CPR}), such as the duration, frequency, and depth of the compressions. Missing from these devices is the ability to automatically detect other common EMS procedures. Information about the patient's care is typically entered into the patient's transcript after completing the patient hand-off to the trauma team. When arriving at the hospital, paramedics can provide records, such as graphs and vital statistics on a tablet, in addition to the standard oral communication protocol. The full transcript can be transmitted via the Internet to the hospital's database when connected to the secured city network. Currently, transferring information is a slow and static process. Real-time information about the patients state may be beneficial for the trauma team before the patient arrives at the hospital.
\par The proposed detection of a sub-set of commonly performed EMS procedures on trauma patients includes: \gls{CPR}, airway management, placing splints, and placing an intravenous (\gls{IV}). CPR is the process of helping a person breath using chest compressions and artificial ventilation. Airway management consists of multiple procedures depending on the severity of the trauma. Bag-valve-mask ventilation provides air for patients with breathing problems, while an orpharyngeal device is used to manage an unresponsive patient's airway. Orpharyngeal devices keep the tongue from obstructing the airway. Severe trauma patients may require intubation in which a tube is inserted orally and reaches into the windpipe. Splinting stabilizes an extremity that is fractured or broken. An intravenous drip allows for fluids and medication to be administered into the patientâ€™s bloodstream.
\par EMS procedures can be broken into their atomical movements using hierarchical task analysis. Defining fine grained movements enables the detection of a procedure using the order of atomical movements. Accelerometer, gyroscope, and \gls{EMG} data are the basis for detecting atomical movements. Physical movement of \gls{EMS} personnel performing a procedure will be recorded and the goal is to automatically recognize the procedure.
\par A major challenge is the requirement of two arms to perform the necessary care for the patient and each arm must be monitored. A second challenge are individual differences in movement when executing procedures. Depending on the EMS personnel movements can vary from using a different finger to another motion. Another challenge are abrupt turns, fast acceleration, and sudden stops of the ambulance, which generates noise unrelated to the EMS personnel's movement, but is detected in accelerometer and gyroscope data and must be filtered.
\par Chapter \ref{ch:Literature-Review} provides background information on existing systems to detect physical movement. Chapter \ref{ch:System-Design} proposes an algorithm that detects trauma procedures by \gls{EMS} personnel. Chapter \ref{ch:Experimental-Design} introduces an experimental design for studies to collect data and test the algorithm. Chapter \ref{ch:Results} presents the results of the studies. Finally, Chapter \ref{ch:Conclusion} outlines the contribution and drawbacks of the algorithm, followed by a discussion how future work could improve the system.
