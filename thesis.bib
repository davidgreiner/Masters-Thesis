	abstract = {Study objective Patient handoffs are known as high-risk events for medical error but little is known about the professional, structural, and interpersonal factors that can affect the patient transition from emergency medical services (EMS) care to the emergency department (ED). We study EMS providers' perspectives to generate hypotheses to inform and improve this handoff. Methods We conducted focus groups with EMS providers recruited at 3 national and regional conferences from January to March 2011 until theme saturation was reached; 7 focus groups were conducted with 48 EMS providers. Deidentified transcripts and notes were entered into QSR NVivo, coded, and analyzed to identify themes. Results EMS providers identified themselves as advocates for their patients during the challenging EMS-to-ED handoffs. Providers identified normative challenges they encounter in their communications with hospital staff, and features of EMS and hospital protocols that either facilitate or undermine effective handoffs from the out-of-hospital environment to the ED. They identified 4 key potential ways to improve the structure and process of the handoff: (1) communicate directly with the ED provider responsible for the patient's care; (2) increase interdisciplinary feedback, transparency, and shared understanding of scope of practice between out-of-hospital and hospital-based providers; (3) standardize some (but not all) aspects of the handoff; and (4) harness technology to close gaps in information exchange. Conclusion These exploratory findings suggest that the effect of increasing EMS interactions with emergency physicians, standardizing handoff processes, and fostering interprofessional learning represent opportunities for future study and may serve as potential solutions for the high-risk EMS-ED patient transition.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: With the increase in shift pattern work for junior doctors in the NHS, accurate handover of patient clinical information is of great importance. There is no published method that forms the gold standard of handover and there are large variations in practice. This study aims to compare the reliability of three different handover methods. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We observed the handover of 12 simulated patients over five consecutive handover cycles between SHOs on a one-to-one basis. Three handover styles were used and a numerical scoring system assessed clinical information lost per handover cycle. RESULTS: After five handover cycles, only 2.5{\%} of patient information was retained using the verbal-only handover method, 85.5{\%} was retained when using the using the verbal with note taking method and 99{\%} was retained when a printed handout containing all patient information was used. CONCLUSIONS: When patient information is handed over by the verbal only method, very few facts are retained; therefore, this method should be avoided whenever possible. Verbal handover with note taking is shown to be an effective method of handover in our study, although we accept that this is an artificial scenario and may not reflect the reality of a busy hospital. Nearly all information is retained by the printed handout method but this relies on the handout being regularly updated.},

	abstract = {Study objective We determine whether there are differences in role-related communication patterns in the emergency department (ED). Methods This was an observational study of a metropolitan ED. Four medical officers and 4 nurses were observed for 19 hours and 52 minutes. Communication load was measured by proportion of observed time in communication, proportion of concurrent communication events, and proportion of interruptions. Results Eight hundred thirty-one communication events were identified, an average of 42 events per person per hour. Eighty-nine percent of clinicians' time was spent in communication. Synchronous communication channels, involving face-to-face or telephone conversations, were used in 84{\%} of events. One third of communication events were classified as interruptions, averaging 15 interruptions per person per hour. Senior medical and nursing staff experienced higher rates of interruption than junior medical staff and registered nurses with an allocated patient load. Conclusion There was considerable variation in communication loads on clinical staff occupying different roles in the ED. Medical registrars had a high proportion of interruptions and spent the most time dealing with interruptions. These new data suggest some clinical roles may be at higher risk of communication overload than those of the general clinical population.},

	abstract = {Background: The Joint Commission has made a "standardized approach to hand-off communications" a National Patient Safety Goal. Method: An interactive 90-minute workshop (hand-off clinic) was developed in 2005 to (1) develop a standardized process for the handoff, (2) create a checklist of critical patient content, and (3) plan for dissemination and training. Conclusion: To date, 7 of 10 residency programs have participated. Analysis of these protocols demonstrated that the hand-off process is highly variable and discipline-specific. Although all disciplines required a verbal handoff, because of competing demands, verbal communication did not always occur. In some cases, the transfer of professional responsibility was separated in time and space from the transfer of information. For example, in two cases, patient tasks were assigned to other team members to facilitate timely departure of a postcall resident (to meet resident duty-hour restrictions), but results were not formally communicated to anyone. The hand-off clinic facilitated the incorporation of "closed-loop" communication by requiring that follow-up on these tasks be conveyed to the on-call resident. Discussion: This model for design and implementation can be applied to other health care settings.},

Innumerable applications can be visualized, for instance, in medical, security, entertainment, and tactical scenarios. Despite human activity recognition (HAR) being an active field for more than a decade, there are still key aspects that, if addressed, would constitute a significant turn in the way people interact with mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art in HAR based on wearable sensors. A general architecture is first presented along with a description of the main components of any HAR system. We also propose a two-level taxonomy in accordance to the learning approach (either supervised or semi-supervised) and the response time (either offline or online). Then, the principal issues and challenges are discussed, as well as the main solutions to each one of them. Twenty eight systems are qualitatively evaluated in terms of recognition performance, energy consumption, obtrusiveness, and flexibility, among others. Finally, we present some open problems and ideas that, due to their high relevance, should be addressed in future research.},

Over the last decade, human action analysis evolved from earlier schemes that are often limited to controlled environments to nowadays advanced solutions that can learn from millions of videos and apply to almost all daily activities. Given the broad range of applications from video surveillance to human–computer interaction, scientific milestones in action recognition are achieved more rapidly, eventually leading to the demise of what used to be good in a short time. This motivated us to provide a comprehensive review of the notable steps taken towards recognizing human actions. To this end, we start our discussion with the pioneering methods that use handcrafted representations, and then, navigate into the realm of deep learning based approaches. We aim to remain objective throughout this survey, touching upon encouraging improvements as well as inevitable fallbacks, in the hope of raising fresh questions and motivating new research directions for the reader.},

To extract features, both statistical and structural detectors are applied, and two new features are proposed to discriminate among activities during periods of vital sign stabilization. After evaluating eight different classifiers and three different time window sizes, our results show that Centinela achieves up to 95.7{\%} overall accuracy, which is higher than current approaches under similar conditions.

Despite this enthusiasm, however, there has been no research on law enforcement command staff perceptions of BWCs. Given the importance that law enforcement leadership plays in the decision to adopt and implement BWCs, it is necessary to assess their perceptions. This is the first study to measure law enforcement leadership attitudes toward BWCs. The study relies on data collected from surveys administered to command staff representing local, state and federal law enforcement agencies in a large southern county. Among the major perceptual findings are that command staff believe BWCs will impact police officers' decisions to use force in encounters with citizens and police will be more reluctant to use necessary force in encounters with the public. Respondents also believe that use of BWCs is supported by the public because society does not trust police, media will use BWC data to embarrass police, and pressure to implement BWCs comes from the media. Perceptions of the impact of BWCs on safety, privacy, and police effectiveness are also discussed.},

	abstract="In robotics research is an increasing need for knowledge about human motions. However humans tend to perceive motion in terms of discrete motion primitives. Most systems use data-driven motion segmentation to retrieve motion primitives. Besides that the actual intention and context of the motion is not taken into account. In our work we propose a procedure for segmenting motions according to their functional goals, which allows a structuring and modeling of functional motion primitives. The manual procedure is the first step towards an automatic functional motion representation. This procedure is useful for applications such as imitation learning and human motion recognition. We applied the proposed procedure on several motion sequences and built a motion recognition system based on manually segmented motion capture data. We got a motion primitive error rate of 0.9Â {\%} for the marker-based recognition. Consequently the proposed procedure yields motion primitives that are suitable for human motion recognition.",

	abstract = {Human daily activity recognition using mobile personal sensing technology plays a central role in the field of pervasive healthcare. One major challenge lies in the inherent complexity of human body movements and the variety of styles when people perform a certain activity. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we present a novel human activity recognition framework based on recently developed compressed sensing and sparse representation theory using wearable inertial sensors. Our approach represents human activity signals as a sparse linear combination of activity signals from all activity classes in the training set. The class membership of the activity signal is determined by solving a l(1) minimization problem. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our sparse representation-based approach by recognizing nine most common human daily activities performed by 14 subjects. Our approach achieves a maximum recognition rate of 96.1{\%}, which beats conventional methods based on nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, and support vector machine by as much as 6.7{\%}. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by using random projection, the task of looking for “optimal features” to achieve the best activity recognition performance is less important within our framework.},

@article{Zheng2008,
	abstract = {Geographic information has spawned many novel Web applications where global positioning system (GPS) plays important roles in bridging the applications and end users. Learning knowledge from users' raw GPS data can provide rich context information for both geographic and mobile applications. However, so far, raw GPS data are still used directly without much understanding. In this paper, an approach based on supervised learning is proposed to automatically infer transportation mode from raw GPS data. The transportation mode, such as walking, driving, etc., implied in a user's GPS data can provide us valuable knowledge to understand the user. It also enables context-aware computing based on user's present transportation mode and design of an innovative user interface for Web users. Our approach consists of three parts: a change point- based segmentation method, an inference model and a post- processing algorithm based on conditional probability. The change point-based segmentation method was compared with two baselines including uniform duration based and uniform length based methods. Meanwhile, four different inference models including Decision Tree, Bayesian Net, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Conditional Random Field (CRF) are studied in the experiments. We evaluated the approach using the GPS data collected by 45 users over six months period. As a result, beyond other two segmentation methods, the change point based method achieved a higher degree of accuracy in predicting transportation modes and detecting transitions between them. Decision Tree outperformed other inference models over the change point based segmentation method. Categories},

	abstract = {This paper presents a technique for view invariant human detection and$\backslash$nextending this idea to recognize basic human actions like walking,$\backslash$njogging, hand waving and boxing etc. To achieve this goal we detect the$\backslash$nhuman in its body parts and then learn the changes of those body parts$\backslash$nfor action recognition. Human-body part detection in different views is$\backslash$nan extremely challenging problem due to drastic change of 3D-pose of$\backslash$nhuman body, self occlusions etc while performing actions. In order to$\backslash$ncope with these problems we have designed three example-based detectors$\backslash$nthat are trained to find separately three components of the human body,$\backslash$nnamely the head, legs and arms. We incorporate 10 sub-classifiers for$\backslash$nthe head, arms and the leg detection. Each sub-classifier detects body$\backslash$nparts under a specific range of viewpoints. Then, view-invariance is$\backslash$nfulfilled by combining the results of these sub classifiers.$\backslash$nSubsequently, we extend this approach to recognize actions based on$\backslash$ncomponent-wise Hidden Markov Models (HMM). This is achieved by designing$\backslash$na HMM for each action, which is trained based on the detected body$\backslash$nparts. Consequently, we are able to distinguish between similar actions$\backslash$nby only considering the body parts which has major contributions to$\backslash$nthose actions e.g. legs for walking, running etc; hands for boxing,$\backslash$nwaving etc.},

	abstract="Wearable trackers can help motivate you during workouts and provide information about your daily routine or fitness in combination with your smartphone without requiring potentially disruptive manual calculations or records. This paper summarizes and compares wearable fitness devices, also called ``fitness trackers'' or ``activity trackers.'' These devices are becoming increasingly popular in personal healthcare, motivating people to exercise more throughout the day without the need for lifestyle changes. The various choices in the market for wearable devices are also increasing, with customers searching for products that best suit their personal needs. Further, using a wearable device or fitness tracker can help people reach a fitness goal or finish line. Generally, companies display advertising for these kinds of products and depict them as beneficial, user friendly, and accurate. However, there are no objective research results to prove the veracity of their words. This research features subjective and objective experimental results, which reveal that some devices perform better than others.",

@article{Parate2014,
	abstract = {Smoking-induced diseases are known to be the leading cause of death in the United States. In this work, we design RisQ, a mobile solution that leverages a wristband containing a 9-axis inertial measurement unit to capture changes in the orientation of a person's arm, and a machine learning pipeline that processes this data to accurately detect smoking gestures and sessions in real-time. Our key innovations are fourfold: a) an arm trajectory-based method that extracts candidate hand-to-mouth gestures, b) a set of trajectory-based features to distinguish smoking gestures from confounding gestures including eating and drinking, c) a probabilistic model that analyzes sequences of hand-to-mouth gestures and infers which gestures are part of individual smoking sessions, and d) a method that leverages multiple IMUs placed on a person's body together with 3D animation of a person's arm to reduce burden of self-reports for labeled data collection. Our experiments show that our gesture recognition algorithm can detect smoking gestures with high accuracy (95.7{\%}), precision (91{\%}) and recall (81{\%}). We also report a user study that demonstrates that we can accurately detect the number of smoking sessions with very few false positives over the period of a day, and that we can reliably extract the beginning and end of smoking session periods.},

	abstract="In this study, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis was applied to EMG signals recorded from ulnar nerves of 59 patients to interpret data. The data of the patients were diagnosed by the neurologists as 19 patients were normal, 20 patients had neuropathy and 20 patients had myopathy. The amount of FFT coefficients had been reduced by using principal components analysis (PCA). This would facilitate calculation and storage of EMG data. PCA coefficients were applied to multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM) and both classified systems of performance values were computed. Consequently, the results show that SVM has high anticipation level in the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders. It is proved that its test performance is high compared with MLP.",
